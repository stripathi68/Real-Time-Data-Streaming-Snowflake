Real-Time Data Streaming using Apache Nifi, AWS, and Snowflake

Overview:

The project highlights my skills in real-time data streaming and cloud data warehousing. The project involves streaming data to Snowflake using Apache Nifi, showcasing efficient end-to-end data pipeline creation and management in a cloud environment. Implemented a real-time data pipeline to stream data via Apache Nifi. Pipelined the data from S3 to Snowflake in near real-time, and successfully implemented Slowly Changing Dimension, Change Data Capture, and Incremental Load using Snowflake Stream and Task.
